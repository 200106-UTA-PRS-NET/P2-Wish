# P2-Wish (DockerFile in MediaWish Folder)

Media Wish is a web application in which allows the user to generate their media wishlist to their liking. Once the user creates an account, they have the ability to find and select any movie or videogame to add to their wishlist. Additionally the user can also generate a list of media they can both view and select from based on a set of filters they specify. Upon selection, the media will be stored in a wishlist in which the user can add, view and/or delete contents from. Each user wishlist is also open to the public , which allows family and friends to view for potential gifts.
